# Hello

Casual Advent of Code 2024. No early rising. Let's see if I can get past day 10 :)

# What did I learn?

**Day 1 - solved**
Part 1: This is easy, lets try to prematurely optimize for part 2. Part 2: never mind!

**Day 2 - solved**
Part 1: nice & easy... but it is still only day 2. Part 2: Solved it, then made it recursive and written in a more
functional style, didn't think it was much of an improvement in this case so did not commit those versions. Update:
refactored it anyway. Better!

**Day 3 - solved**
Part 1: finally got the hang of capture groups... better late than never. Really quick solve. Part 2: Put the enable
flag in the wrong place (inside the for loop) so spent a lot of time scratching my head because my answer was too
high...

**Day 4 - solved**
Part 1: I wrote a really clever util I can re-use. Too bad it had a little bug (no matrix edge detection) that took me
reeeeeally long to spot. Part 2: super quick, the work paid off.

**Day 5 - solved**
Part 1 and 2: not much to say, pretty straightforward

**Day 6**
Part 1: Good challenge, did take quite some time though! Part 2: Hmmm, have yet to figure this one out. I got loops, but
too many :/

**Day 7 - solved**
Part 1: Another day, another "why the fuck does this not work??? Oh wait it works. WHY???" Part 2: I guess playing wih
assembly, binary end hex over the past weeks for my studies paid off.

**Day 8**
Part 1: Another "why does it work on the test input but not on the puzzle". Out of time for today, maybe tonight
