# Hello

Casual Advent of Code 2024. No early rising. Let's see if I can get past day 10 :)

# What did I learn?

**Day 1**
Part 1: This is easy, lets try to prematurely optimize for part 2. Part 2: never mind!

**Day 2**
Part 1: nice & easy... but it is still only day 2. Part 2: Solved it, then made it recursive and written in a more
functional style, didn't think it was much of an improvement in this case so did not commit those versions. Update:
refactored it anyway. Better!
